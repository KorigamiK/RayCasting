## Raycasting with SDL2 and C
This is a raycasting demo written in c using the SDL2 library for drawing. 
I made it for my youtube channel Eclips-Coding([link](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6gXOq20FwPT1_AMFX6TEyw)).
I also made a video showing the program in running([link](PLACE HOLDER)).
### Controls
In the main demo the controls are fairly simple:
* WASD to move arround
* QE to turn the player

In the level editor its also fairly simple, just click where you want the line to start and where you want the line to end. Also a quick tip is to overlap the end of lines as a 1 pixel gap can look very large due to the low resolution.
### Instalation
I use SDL2, gcc and make. To install these for you OS i suggest looking for a guide as these are just general purpose good tools.
